This isn't really a file format.
It's just a test structure.

offset    type      name
0         uint8     a
1         int8      b
2         uint16le  c
4         int16le   d
6         uint32le  e
0x0a      int32le   f
0x0e      uint16be  g
0x10      int16be   h
0x12      uint32be  i
0x16      int32be   j
